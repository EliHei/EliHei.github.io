I am a fifth year undergrad of double majors at Sharif University of Technology in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. During my BSc studies I have been conducting research mostly in Development of Statistical Methods, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning on Biological Data in collaboration with European Molecular Biology Laboratory ([Dr. Wolfgang Huber](http://www.huber.embl.de)), Carnegie Mellon University ([Dr. Hossein Mohimani](http://mohimanilab.cbd.cmu.edu)), Royan Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Technology ([Dr. Koorosh Shahpasand](https://www.omicsonline.org/speaker/koorosh-shahpasand-royan-institute-for-stem-cell-biology-and-technology-iran/)), and Yazd Cardiovascular Research Center ([Dr. Mahmood Sadr]()). I am currently a research fellow in bAIo Lab of Sharif University of Techonology, working on machine learning methods for bioinformatics under supervision of [Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbJMZLIAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I was a research assistant in behavioral genetics in Bioinfromatics Lab of Sharif University of Technology under supervision of [Dr. Abolfazl Motahhari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJ-biB0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Research Intresets:
